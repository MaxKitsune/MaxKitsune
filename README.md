Hey there, I'm using GitHub! ^w^

4th Semester AI & Data Science Student from Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

##  What I'm into
- Machine Learning & AI: Exploring algorithms and TTS voice cloning, plus uploading samples of my university projects.
- Browser-based tools: My current project helps with fact-checking stuff online; will be released if it works as intended :p
- Homelabbing: Maybe you'll find some related stuff to homeservers like pihole or homeassistant someday

## What else counts
- Passionate about tech ethics, accessibility & trustworthy systems. Something that has a positive impact.
- Open to internships abroad and always ready to learn something new
